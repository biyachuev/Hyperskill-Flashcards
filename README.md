# Hyperskill-Flashcards
Hyperskill learning project Description

A flashcard is a digital or paper card that contains a term on one side, and a definition, translation, or explanation of that term on the other. Flashcards are often used for learning foreign languages and are an effective study technique for many people.

For this project, weâ€™ll refer to the text on the front of the card as the term, and the text on the back will be the definition. You will create an application that emulates a set of flashcards on the screen. While developing this application, you will not only learn some programming, but also save paper!
